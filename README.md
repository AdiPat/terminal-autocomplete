> 🚨 **Disclaimer:** Terminal Autocomplete is an experimental hacker's tool. Expect brilliance, quirks, and opportunities to outsmart your shell.

Terminal Autocomplete isn’t your average terminal enhancement—it’s a calculated leap into the future of command-line intelligence. It merges the raw power of Python with the precision of OpenAI’s neural models to deliver smarter completions, historical insights, and a dynamic shell experience. Every keystroke becomes a collaboration between your mind and the machine. We’re redefining what it means to wield the terminal. 🧩

## Introduction 🖤

**Terminal Autocomplete 🧠** is a **hacker’s secret weapon**, engineered to evolve how we interact with the command line. It’s not just about speeding up commands—it’s about mastering your environment.  

Here’s the deal: the terminal doesn’t need to be a passive tool anymore. With **dynamic AI-powered completions**, **persistent history tracking**, and **intelligent learning**, Terminal Autocomplete transforms your shell into a co-conspirator.  

> 💬 "It’s a hacker’s shell companion—fast, adaptive, and just smart enough to make you feel invincible."

## Problem Statement 🕵️‍♂️

1. **Command Repetition:** How many times have you typed the same patterns of commands, wishing the terminal could just anticipate your needs? 😤  
2. **Static History:** Traditional shell history is an unstructured dump of everything you’ve ever done. Terminal Autocomplete curates it, remembers what matters, and builds on it. 🧩  
3. **AI Ignorance:** Your terminal is blind to the power of AI. By integrating OpenAI, Terminal Autocomplete predicts your moves, suggesting context-aware commands and taking your shell game to the next level. ⚡

## Setup & Usage 🔧

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+**  
- **OpenAI API Key** (for AI-enhanced suggestions).  

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/terminal-autocomplete.git
   cd terminal-autocomplete
   ```

2. **Install the package**:  
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

3. **Set up the autocomplete system**:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m terminal_autocomplete -i
   ```

4. **Start the server**:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m terminal_autocomplete --start
   ```

### How It Works

Once installed:
- **Tab-Triggered Genius**: Typing a partial command and pressing `Tab` activates the system. Suggestions are fetched dynamically based on **your history** and **OpenAI’s intelligence**.  
- **History Logging**: Every command is stored, analyzed, and made available for future sessions—because the machine learns.  

To uninstall the system:  
```bash
python3 -m terminal_autocomplete -u
```
